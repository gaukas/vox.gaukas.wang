I decided to start a new blog once again to record my thoughts and ideas, despite previous failures of maintaining a blog. 

The reason for building it with Jekyll is simple: I am tired of building and maintaining my own webserver stack. Now I'd rather focus on the content itself, and let Github Pages handle the rest. 

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

<!-- {% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %} -->

```ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```

I hope you find something interesting here. Cheers!
